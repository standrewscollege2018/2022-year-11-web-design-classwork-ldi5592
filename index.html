<h1>United Kingdom</h1>

<p>I spent a lot of time in the UK, and travelled around as much as I could. Obviously, London was amazing, but there were plenty of other highlights!
</p>

<p>We visited lots of churches and castles. The UK is filled with so many historic sights that you could spend years trying to see them all.

  <h1>Italy</h1>

  <p>We loved Italy! From the ancient ruins to the beautiful scenery and delicious food, we still have many wonderful memories.

<h1>Greece</h1>

<p>Greece was a stunning surprise. We stayed in Crete for a week and were seduced by the scenery, history and the sheer friendliness of the locals.
</p>

<p>We also spent time in Athens, marvelling at many of the ancient ruins.</p>

<h1>France</h1>

<p>We hit France in the middle of a heat-wave, and spent a lot of time either indoors or hiding in the shade.</p>

<p>Paris was wonderful, and we enjoyed walking along the banks of River Seine, plus seeing all the famous sights.</p>

<p>We also drove down to Mont St Michel and visited the beaches of Normandy.</p>
